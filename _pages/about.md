> I am a man of vehement disposition, with violent enthusiasms, and extreme immoderation in all my passions. - **Oliver Sacks**

### Hi there.

I’m **Madhav Shekhar Sharma** and I am passionate about computer science, building things and celebrating the joy of programming. I also love learning [Machine Learning](https://colah.github.io/) and reading [Mythology](https://devdutt.com/)<sub>(mostly *hindu fanfic*)</sub>

Currently, I'm a high school senior. In my free time I am generally found learning ML, [doing courses](https://www.coursera.org/user/8c865912ebd7cf93e98262b5bf6191e6) **and/or** browsing reddit.

This website is about my experimentation in creating and following a system for constant personal growth by [documenting my projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/) and [writing about my future projects ideas.]()

If you’d like to connect, feel free to [email](mailto:talktosharmadhav@gmail.com).

### Colophon

This website is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks, by [fastAI](https://www.fast.ai/).

For the design, it uses a *slightly modified* [minima theme](https://github.com/PseudoCodeNerd/blog/blob/master/_sass/minima/fastpages-styles.scss) for Jekyll and PyCharm's [dracula highlighting](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) for code-blocks.

Beautiful landing image of the site is courtesy of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).<br>
For typography, it uses the [Inter Typface](https://rsms.me/inter/) family. Mono-spaced goodness is provided by [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) Mono.

Lastly, [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is used to publish on Github, where all the code for this website is freely [available.](https://github.com/PseudoCodeNerd/blog)
